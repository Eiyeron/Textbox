# Changelog

## Unreleased
### Added
- Added MP3 samples for demo sample for flash target.
### Changed
- Changed the internal character structure for an ADT enumeration. Nothing should visually change. It's a part of cleaning process.
- Renamed an internal class.
- Removed a few seemingly useless setters in textbox.
- Removed usage of FlxTypedGroup in TextboxLine. Didn't serve a sensible goal in the end.
- Removed a few unit test-related cruft.
### Fixed
- Fixed demos not compiling on static.
- Fixed super constructor call in Textbox, blocking Flash target to compile.
## 0.0.4 - 2018-12-04
### Added
### Changed
- Switched from `FlxTween`'s tween type variables to `FlxTweenType` enumeration, avoiding deprecation messages on Haxeflixel 4.5.1+.
- Added a few haxedef defines to avoid compiling useless chunks of Haxeflixel in tests.
### Fixed
- (static platforms) Parsing non-hexadecimal characters wouldn't trigger a parsing error fallback as `parseInt` returns 0 and not `null`.
- Added a few additonal unit tests around invalid character code parsing.

### Added
- (html5) Added `characterSpacingHack` in `Settings` to replace the magic cookie used for fixing character spacing.
